# Paul Sweeney - MS2: Anyweather App.

My goal for my second milestone project was to develop a simple weather app with some CSS styling to give it a sleek and professional look for the end user.
### This project was created using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

1 - The aim of the app is pretty straight forward, the user enters their destination and the results returned show realtime conditions including, Temperature, Conditions i.e "Mild", "Fair" and so forth, Humidity and Wind Speed.
